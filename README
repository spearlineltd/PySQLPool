What is PySQLPool
=================

PySQLPool is at the heart a MySQL Connection Pooling library for use with the PyMySQL Python bindings.

Part of the PySQLPool is the MySQL Query class that handles all the thread safe connection locking,
connection management in association with the Connection Manager, and cursor management.

Please note that this is not maintained.  The 0.3.7 branch has been updated to handle Python 3 and is
the new master branch, but we will be doing no further development on it.

Installation
============

Linux/Mac OS X:
cd PySQLPool
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
